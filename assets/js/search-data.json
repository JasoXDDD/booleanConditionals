Relational Operators can work between any two values of the same type known as operands, provided that the type supports such types of operators They consist of the operators ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, each one working the same way that they work as one would expect, with == being the replacement for equal to, since = is reserved for value assignments. . They also work on other types, such as string or list, and values at each index is compared in order to determine which one is greater for example: &quot;abg&quot;&lt;&quot;acd&quot; returns True, since the computer first goes to a and a, after they are the same, they go to b and c, and since c is &quot;greater&quot; than b, &quot;acd&quot; is greater than &quot;abg&quot; . print(&quot;True:&quot;,4 4) print(&quot;True:&quot;,1 0) print(&quot;False:&quot;,7 3) print(&quot;True:&quot;,5 6) print(&quot;False:&quot;,7 8) print(&quot;True:&quot;,3 3) print(&#39;&#39;) # Same as above, but now for other values other than int print(&#39;True:&#39;,&quot;as&quot; &quot;as&quot;) print(&quot;False&quot;,True False) print(&quot;False:&quot;,[2,3,1] [2,3,1]) print(&quot;True:&quot;,&#39;af&#39; &#39;bc&#39;) print(&quot;False:&quot;,&#39;ce&#39; &#39;cf&#39;) print(&quot;True:&quot;,[1,&#39;b&#39;] [1,&#39;a&#39;]) print(&#39;&#39;) .

What is a conditional? . A conditional is a statement that affects the flow/outcome of a program by executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement. That true or false statement is a boolean expression. . Conditionals appear in almost every programming language because of how important it is for changing the flow of the program. . Conditionals statements are used by the selection process for a program. . Question: What statement most commonly fills the role of a conditional in almost all programming languages? . If/Else Statements . In almost every programming language, if/else statements fill in the role of the conditional. Some languages call this switch blocks but if/else is the most used term. . If/Else Statement Example: . number = 3 # value that will affect true or false statement if number == 5: # if part determines if the statement is true or false compared to another part of the program print(&quot;yes, 5 does equal 5&quot;) else: #else part only executes if the if part is false print(&quot;no, &quot; + str(number) + &quot; does not equal 5&quot;) . no, 3 does not equal 5 . If/Else Statements can also just be if statements. This can be used more as an interruption rather then yes or no response. . If Statement Example: . progress = 0 while progress &lt; 100: print(str(progress) + &quot;%&quot;) if progress == 50: print(&quot;Half way there&quot;) progress = progress + 10 print(&quot;100%&quot; + &quot; Complete&quot;) . 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Half way there 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Complete .",
