Chilla, Prasith M. | 0.7 | The code is the same as the one given from the fastpages but had the input also turned in late which gave a .7. | . Deng, Zeen | 0.9 | The program has added code that works to form another function. The added code uses if statement and binary correctly which also shows understanding. | .

What is a conditional? . A conditional is a statement that affects the flow/outcome of a program by executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement. That true or false statement is a boolean expression. . Conditionals appear in almost every programming language because of how important it is for changing the flow of the program. . Conditionals statements are used by the selection process for a program. . Question: What statement most commonly fills the role of a conditional in almost all programming languages? . If/Else Statements . In almost every programming language, if/else statements fill in the role of the conditional. Some languages call this switch blocks but if/else is the most used term. . If/Else Statement Example: . number = 3 # value that will affect true or false statement if number == 5: # if part determines if the statement is true or false compared to another part of the program print(&quot;yes, 5 does equal 5&quot;) else: #else part only executes if the if part is false print(&quot;no, &quot; + str(number) + &quot; does not equal 5&quot;) . no, 3 does not equal 5 . If/Else Statements can also just be if statements. This can be used more as an interruption rather then yes or no response. . If Statement Example: . progress = 0 while progress &lt; 100: print(str(progress) + &quot;%&quot;) if progress == 50: print(&quot;Half way there&quot;) progress = progress + 10 print(&quot;100%&quot; + &quot; Complete&quot;) . 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Half way there 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Complete .",
