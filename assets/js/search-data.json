You must use conditional statements within your code and have a input box for where the decimal number will go. This will give you a 2.7 out of 3 and you may add anything else to the code to get above a 2.7. . Below is an example of decimal number to binary converter which you can use as a starting template. . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = 67 print(&quot;Binary of num 67 is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) .",

What is a conditional? . A conditional is a statement that affects the flow/outcome of a program by executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement. That true or false statement is a boolean expression. . Conditionals appear in almost every programming language because of how important it is for changing the flow of the program. . Conditionals statements are used by the selection process for a program. . Question: What statement most commonly fills the role of a conditional in almost all programming languages? . If/Else Statements . In almost every programming language, if/else statements fill in the role of the conditional. Some languages call this switch blocks but if/else is the most used term. . If/Else Statement Example: . number = 3 # value that will affect true or false statement if number == 5: # if part determines if the statement is true or false compared to another part of the program print(&quot;yes, 5 does equal 5&quot;) else: #else part only executes if the if part is false print(&quot;no, &quot; + str(number) + &quot; does not equal 5&quot;) . no, 3 does not equal 5 . If/Else Statements can also just be if statements. This can be used more as an interruption rather then yes or no response. . If Statement Example: . progress = 0 while progress &lt; 100: print(str(progress) + &quot;%&quot;) if progress == 50: print(&quot;Half way there&quot;) progress = progress + 10 print(&quot;100%&quot; + &quot; Complete&quot;) . 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Half way there 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Complete .",
